<h2> Introduction to our Project:</h2>
<p>We live in an era where technology is advancing. Even as technology has simplified our lives to a great extent, finding labor is still a challenge.</p>
<p> There are many unskilled workers who have a great ability to fix problems of our daily needs like if there is a problem with our furniture, TV, plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Through this App we can book the laborer based on GPS location and rating of employees, a message is sent to the person concerned, who may respond to it based on availability.
 </p>
 <p> The main purpose of this app is to supply labor and service on demand. </p>
